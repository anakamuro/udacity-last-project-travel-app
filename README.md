> * TRAVEL APP

My travel app will be able to show the longitude and latitude of the destination city, and the weather content and the temperature of the city andthe picture of the city by using the three APIs.

> * 3 APIs

I used three APIs, geonmaes for logitude and latitude, weatherbit API for the weather content and the temperature, pixabay for thepicture of the city. I need to get the account for those three APIs and need to get username for geonamesAPI and API key for weatherbit API and pixabay API.
